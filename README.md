## Usage

Once the project is installed and running, you can interact with the application through your web browser.

1.  🌐 **Navigate to the Application**:
    Open your browser and go to the address displayed by Vite (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

2.  📝 **Register for an Account**:
    *   Click on "Get Started" or navigate to the `/signup` page.
    *   Fill in your Full Name, Email, and a secure Password.
    *   Click "Sign Up" to create your account. Your credentials will be stored in your browser's `localStorage`.

3.  🔑 **Log In**:
    *   Navigate to the `/login` page.
    *   Enter the Email and Password you used during registration.
    *   Click "Login". Upon successful authentication, your login session will be stored locally, and you will be redirected to the Dashboard.

4.  📊 **Access the Dashboard**:
    *   After logging in, you'll be on the `/dashboard` page.
